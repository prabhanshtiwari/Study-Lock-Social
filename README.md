# Study Lock — Focus Extension + Social Learning Community

Study Lock is a Chrome Manifest V3 learning-focus extension plus an optional Node.js/Express/MongoDB social platform. Learners can focus on YouTube lessons, track local progress, and choose to connect their study summaries to the community leaderboard.

## Chrome extension

**Current extension version: 2.4.0**

Features include native YouTube playback with a focus overlay; click-to-start on supported YouTube pages; video/playlist session selection; 1× playback and seeking enforcement attempts; unique watch coverage and qualifying playback estimates; end-and-close and resume; requested display wake lock; a custom new-tab dashboard; daily goals and history; study plans/reminders; notes/bookmarks; revision flashcards and self-assessment; accessibility preferences; JSON backup/restore; and optional Chrome Sync.

The extension keeps study data on the device by default. Connecting to the social backend is optional and requires the learner to enter the deployed API URL and sign in. Connected users can choose to sync study summaries to their community account. The leaderboard is opt-in by default.

## Social platform

The included Express/MongoDB backend and web portal provide:

- Account registration/login, email verification, password reset, token revocation on logout/password reset, and permanent account deletion.
- Profiles, privacy settings, leaderboard opt-in, daily anti-inflation caps, qualifying study stats, achievements, and weekly/monthly/all-time rankings.
- Learner discovery, friend requests, remove/block/unblock, friend-only messaging, and account/message/challenge reporting.
- Public/friend challenges with server-calculated progress for study minutes, lesson completions, and streak days.
- Moderator tools for reviewing reports, suspending accounts, deleting challenges, managing quizzes, and awarding quiz prizes.
- A responsive web portal with overview, leaderboards, discovery, friends, messages, challenges, profile/privacy settings, and data export.
- **Admin-built scheduled quizzes:** add up to 100 custom questions per quiz; choose single-choice, multiple-choice, true/false, or short-answer types; set opening/closing dates, the individual attempt duration, publication state, and a maximum participant count.
- **Server-enforced attempts and public results:** answer autosave, server-side scoring, automatic timeout finalization, one attempt per user per quiz, participant-cap enforcement, and a leaderboard that stays hidden until the scheduled quiz end time. Scheduled results are calculated from server-stored answers, not browser-submitted scores.
- **Unique, deterministic ranks:** score descending, then shorter elapsed time, earlier final submission time, username A–Z, and stable user ID. The displayed rank is a unique row number (1, 2, 3…), so users never share a rank.
- **Admin winner management:** from the finalized leaderboard an admin can open the participant’s full profile/contact details, select or revise a cash-prize amount, and optionally attach a note. A prize is shown publicly only after the winner confirms receipt. This marks and records a prize; it does **not** transfer money automatically.
- **Quick Launch strip:** ten default site shortcuts (Google, YouTube, Gmail, Drive, Classroom, ChatGPT, GitHub, LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, Khan Academy), each opens in a new tab. Users can add, edit, delete, and save up to ten HTTPS shortcuts per profile.
- **Profile contact number:** registration requires a phone number, but no SMS/phone verification is performed. Phone numbers are not shown publicly; quiz admin contact details are shown only from a published quiz’s finalized leaderboard.
- **CRUD controls:** learners can create/read/update/delete their own account/profile; users retain the existing challenge creation/join/progress functions; admins can list, edit, and delete challenges, and create/read/update/delete quizzes. Question/schedule edits lock after the first participant attempt to preserve result integrity. Quizzes with attempts cannot be unpublished because that would hide results from learners.

### Stack

- Node.js 20+ (Node 22 LTS recommended)
- Express 4, Helmet, CORS and `express-rate-limit`
- MongoDB Atlas Free (small early-access/beta workload)
- Mongoose 8
- JWT for API sessions, bcryptjs for password hashing
- HTTPS email API compatible with Resend for verification and reset messages

## Quick local API setup

```bash
cd server
cp .env.example .env
# Fill MONGODB_URI and a random 32+ character JWT_SECRET.
# Set NODE_ENV=development for local use and optionally configure the email API.
npm install
npm run check
npm test
npm start
```

Portal: `http://localhost:3000`  
Health: `http://localhost:3000/health`  
API summary: `http://localhost:3000/api/docs`

Without `MONGODB_URI`, local server boot can be used for static portal inspection only; database-backed API actions won't work. Production startup requires MongoDB and the email provider settings.

## Deployment

Follow **[DEPLOY_RENDER.md](DEPLOY_RENDER.md)** for step-by-step setup of MongoDB Atlas, email verification, Render Blueprint deployment, admin setup, connecting the extension, and the live verification checklist.

Important: Render Free services are useful for hobby projects, demos, and beta testing but Render's own documentation says not to use Free services for production applications. They sleep after 15 minutes idle and wake on the next request. Atlas Free is limited to 0.5 GB storage and limited throughput. Plan a paid/hardened deployment before expecting always-on availability or sustained public traffic. See [Render Free limits](https://render.com/docs/free) and [Atlas Free cluster limits](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/reference/free-shared-limitations/).

## Environment variables

See [`server/.env.example`](server/.env.example). At minimum, production needs:

- `MONGODB_URI`: private Atlas connection string, never client-side.
- `JWT_SECRET`: at least 32 random characters; generate in Render.
- `EMAIL_API_KEY` and `EMAIL_FROM`: API key and verified sender for email verification/password reset.
- `PUBLIC_APP_URL`: optional canonical HTTPS app origin; on Render the code falls back to `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` automatically.
- `ADMIN_EMAILS`: comma-separated email addresses that should receive moderator role at registration; set before those accounts are created.
- `ALLOW_EXTENSION_ORIGINS=true`: enable extension-origin requests. For a hardened published extension, restrict this rule to the known extension ID.
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: optional exact extra origins, comma-separated without trailing slashes.

## Tests and verification

Run these from the project root:

```bash
node --check background.js
node --check content.js
node --check newtab.js
node --check popup.js
node tests/background-smoke-test.cjs
cd server
npm run check
npm test
```

The included tests cover pure business rules, quiz scoring and deterministic rank rules, study-event caps/points, API route references, portal ID wiring, extension social integration references, and mocked extension flows. **This package has not been deployed to live Render/Atlas in this environment, and a live YouTube end-to-end test was not possible.** The existing `server/package-lock.json` is included and aligned to API version `1.1.0`, but dependency installation could not be verified in this environment because npm registry access failed. Run `npm ci` on a network-connected machine before deployment and keep the lock file updated when dependencies change. Treat this as a feature-complete beta candidate, not a certified security-audited production service.

## Before opening to the public

1. Complete the support/controller contact in `server/public/privacy.html`.
2. Ensure the operator can respond to abuse reports and account deletion requests.
3. Deploy using the live steps, verify email flows, and run the two-account test checklist.
4. Run `npm ci` against the included `server/package-lock.json` from a network-connected development machine, and update the lock file whenever dependencies change.
5. Set data retention/backup policies and monitor Atlas storage. Study event records accumulate; the free cluster is not sized for large communities.
6. Review the privacy notice and community rules against your actual jurisdiction and data processing.
7. Do not describe watch time as proof of attention or comprehension; client-reported playback is only a signal and can be manipulated.

## Versioning

- Extension: `2.4.0`
- Social API/portal: `1.1.0` (scheduled quiz platform and profile quick links)
